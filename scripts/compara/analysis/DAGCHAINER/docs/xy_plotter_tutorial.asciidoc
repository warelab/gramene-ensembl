The DAGchainer XY-Plotter Tutorial
==================================

The plotter can be used with only the initial match list, or with both the match list and the syntenic pairs reported by DAGchainer.  First, we highlight the use of the plotter with the match list alone and using the Arabidopsis sample data set. 

We can launch the plotter from the root of the installation directory like so:

  % Java_XY_plotter/run_XYplot.pl data_sets/Arabidopsis/Arabidopsis.Release5.matchList

The result is shown below:

image:xy_plotter_images/arab_2vs4.small.gif["arabidopsis chr2 vs. chr4",link="xy_plotter_images/arab_2vs4.gif"]

In this view, chrosome 2 is ordered along the Y-axis and chromosome 4 is ordered along the X-axis.  Each pair of matching genes is shown as a single dot in the plot.  The left and right mouse buttons can be used to either select matches of gene pairs or to zoom in on selected regions.

To zoom in on a region, use the right mouse button and drag a rectangle over the region of interest. For example:

image:xy_plotter_images/arab_2vs4.select.small.gif["select region of plot",link="xy_plotter_images/arab_2vs4.select.gif"]

The zoomed display is shown below:

image:xy_plotter_images/arab_2vs4.zoomed.small.gif["zoomed region of plot",link="xy_plotter_images/arab_2vs4.zoomed.gif"]

In the zoomed display, the scrollbars at the right and bottom of the display can be used to navigate the region in the viewer.  

Filtering Matches in the Display
--------------------------------

The pairwise matches between genes can be filtered based on their repetitiveness or by asserting an E-value threshold.  To obtain the match filter controller, select from the menu bar MatchDisplay -> 'Show matches by E-value'.

Two controls allow you to filter the match.  The Maximum Log E-value option can be used to exclude matches from the display that are above the set E-value threshold.  This can be used to restrict the display to only the best matching genes.  In addition, the Max # of Matches filter can be used to restrict the display to include only those genes that have at most the specified number of different gene matches.  By setting this to one, only those genes that uniquely match another gene are shown.  By using these filters, you can effectively explore different signal to noise ratios among the set of matches, often revealing patterns to the eye that are otherwise difficult to detect.

Below is an example of our plotted region showing only the unique matches.

Selecting Matches from the Display
----------------------------------

Using the left mouse button, you can draw a rectangle around a set of matches as shown below:

image:xy_plotter_images/arab_2vs4.zoomed.gene_selection.small.gif["selecting matching gene pairs within the plot",link="xy_plotter_images/arab_2vs4.zoomed.gene_selection.gif"]

The selected matches are then circled in the display, and the corresponding match information from the original match input file is printed to the terminal.

  Selected region is: (14645347,8019225) , (14933095,8306688)

Illustrating Matches and DAGchainer Reported Syntenic Regions
-------------------------------------------------------------

Both the original match list and the output from DAGchainer can be used as input to the XY plotter like so:

  Java_XY_plotter/run_XYplot.pl data_sets/Arabidopsis/Arabidopsis.Release5.matchList data_sets/Arabidopsis/Arabidopsis.Release5.matchList.filtered.aligncoords

The regions reported by DAGchainer as candidate syntenic genes are highlighted with a random color, and each chain is colored differently, as shown below:

image:xy_plotter_images/arab_2vs4.with_chains.small.gif["image with diagonals colored",link="xy_plotter_images/arab_2vs4.with_chains.gif"]

The menu option Diagonals->'Toggle show diagonals' can be used to toggle the diagonal coloring on/off.
