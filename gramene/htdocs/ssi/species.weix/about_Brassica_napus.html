<h2 id="about">About <em>Brassica napus</em></h2>

<p>Oilseed rape (<em>Brassica napus</em>) was formed ~7,500 years ago by hybridization between <em>B. rapa</em> and <em>B. oleracea</em>, followed by chromosome doubling, a process known as allopolyploidy. Together with more ancient polyploidizations, this conferred an aggregate 72-fold genome multiplication since the origin of angiosperms and high gene content. Cultivation began in Europe during the Middle Ages and spread worldwide. Diversifying selection gave rise to oilseed rape (canola), rutabaga, fodder rape, and kale morphotypes grown for oil, fodder, and food.</p>

<h3 id="assembly">Assembly</h3>

<p>The homozygous <em>B. napus</em> genome of European winter oilseed cultivar ‘Darmor-<em>bzh</em>’ was assembled with long-read 454 GS-FLX+ Titanium and Sanger sequence. Correction and gap filling used 79 Gbp of Illumina HiSeq sequence. The final assembly of 849.7 Mbp was obtained using SOAP and Newbler, with 89% nongapped sequence. The assembly covers ~79% of the 1,130 Mbp genome and includes 95.6% of <em>Brassica</em> expressed sequence tags (ESTs) [1].</p>

<p>A total of 101,040 gene models were estimated from 35.5 Gbp of RNA-Seq data in combination with <em>ab initio</em> gene prediction, protein and EST alignments, and transposon masking. Of these, 91,167 were confirmed by matches with <em>B. rapa</em> and/or <em>B. oleracea</em> predicted proteomes [1].</p>
