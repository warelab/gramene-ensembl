<h2 id="about">About <em>Galdieria sulphuraria</em></h2>

<p>Galdieria sulphuraria is an extremophilic unicellular species of red algae. It is the type species of the genus Galdieria. It is known for its broad metabolic capacities, including photosynthesis and heterotrophic growth on over 50 different extracellular carbon sources. The members of the Cyanidiophyceae family are among the most acidophilic known photosynthetic organisms, and the growth conditions of G. sulphuraria, pH between 0 and 4, and temperatures up to 56Â°C, are among the most extreme known for eukaryotes. Analysis of its genome suggests that its thermoacidophilic adaptations derive from horizontal gene transfer from archaea and bacteria, another rarity among eukaryotes.</p>
