<h2 id="about">About <em>Glycine max</em></h2>

<p><em>Glycine max</em> (soybean) is a crop legume that globally constitutes one of the most important sources of animal feed protein and cooking oil. Having originated in East Asia soy is now cultivated world-wide with greatest production in the U.S. Though only a minor proportion of the crop is eaten directly by humans, soybean is a valuable source of protein, containing all essential amino acids, and frequently used as a dietary substitute for meat. Like other legumes, soybean is able to fix atmospheric nitrogen by engaging in a symbiotic relationship with microbial organisms. The complete sequence of the soybean genome not only impacts research and breeding of this crop, but also serves as a reference for genomics research in other legumes. Representing the order Fabales within the eudicot taxonomy, the sequence will also advance research in comparative phylogenomics. As a paleopolyploid, the soybean genome shows evidence of two ancient whole genome duplications, one early in the legume lineage and a second more recent event specific to the soybean lineage. The soybean genome has 20 chromosomes and an estimated size of 1,115 Mbp.</p>

<p><em>Glycine max</em> var. Williams 82 was sequenced, assembled, and annotated by the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) in collaboration with a consortium of research labs and published in 2010. About 13 million shotgun Sanger reads were assembled into 20 chromosomes totalling 975 Mbp with an additional amount in unmapped scaffolds.</p>

<p>The v1.1 gene set integrates ~1.6 M ESTs and 1.5 billion paired-end Illumina RNA-seq reads with homology- and <em>ab initio</em>-based gene predictions. A total of 54,175 protein-coding loci were predicted and classified into six levels of support (see <a href="http://www.phytozome.net/soybean_er.php">JGI Phytozome</a> for additional details).</p>
