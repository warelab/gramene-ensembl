<h2 id="about">About <em>Amborella trichopoda</em></h2>

<p><em>Amborella trichopoda</em> is a small, tropical shrub endemic to New Caledonia. It is the only species in the genus Amborella, which is the only member of the family Amborellaceae. As the only living species on the sister lineage to all other flowering plants, it is an important reference for studying plant evolution. Individual Amborella trichopoda are usually sprawling understory shrubs, although occasionally they grow up to eight meters high. They have evergreen leaves and small, white to yellow flowers. The species is dioecious; female plants producing carpals and males producing stamens, and individual plants can change sex between flowerings. Unlike nearly all other flowering plants, they do not posses vessel elements for water conduction. Amborella's genome is a relatively compact 870Mb, arranged into 13 chromosome pairs.</p>

<p>Amborella's draft genome sequence was published in December, 2013, by the <a href="http://www.amborella.org" target="_blank">Amborella Genome Project</a> [1,2]. Initial sequencing and contig assembly was performed using a whole-genome shotgun (WGS) strategy. Contigs and scaffold assignments were refined, and superscaffolds constructed from them using evidence from end-sequenced BACs, single-molecule restriction digest (OpGen) experiments, and fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) experiments.</p>

<p>Ab initio annotation of genes and repetitive elements was performed using the DAWGPAWS [3] and EVidenceModeler [4] software packages. These annotations were refined through manual comparison with assembled Amborella cDNA transcripts, gene family analyses, and homology studies.</p>
