<h2 id="about">About <em>Setaria italica</em></h2>

<p><em>Setaria italica</em> (foxtail millet) is a grain crop widely grown in Asia with particular significance in semi-arid regions of Northern China. It is also grown on a moderate scale in other parts of the world as a forage crop. It is one of the oldest domesticated crops with archeological remains from 7,500 to 7,900 years BP in northern China. Motivation for sequencing foxtail millet includes its close relationship, both genetically and physiologically, to the biofuel crop switchgrass (<em>Panicum virgatum</em>). Direct study of switchgrass is complicated by its large genome size and polyploidy. Data from the foxtail millet genome assists in study and improvement of switchgrass and related biofuel crops. The nuclear genome (~490 Mbp) is diploid with 9 chromosomes (2n=18).</p>

<h3 id="assembly">Assembly</h3>

<p><em>Setaria italica</em> cv. Yugu1 was sequenced and assembled by the <a href="http://www.jgi.doe.gov/">Joint Genome Institute (JGI)</a> in collaboration with community researchers. Sanger sequencing was performed on whole-genome shotgun clone libraries having different insert sizes. Reads totalling 8.29x coverage were assembled with <a href="http://seqanswers.com/wiki/Arachne">Arachne</a> giving scaffolds that were arranged predominantly into 9 pseudomolecules.</p>
