<p>Carrot is a globally important root crop whose production has quadrupled between 1976 and 2013, outpacing the overall rate of increase in vegetable production and world population growth through development of high-value products for fresh consumption, juices, and natural pigments and cultivars adapted to warmer production regions[1]</p>

<h3>Assembly</h3>

<p>An orange, doubled-haploid, Nantes-type carrot (DH1) was used for genome sequencing. BAC end sequences was used and a newly developed linkage map with 2,075 markers to correct 135 scaffolds with one or more chimeric regions.</p>

<p>The resulting v2.0 assembly spans 421.5 Mbp and contains 4,907 scaffolds (N50 of 12.7 Mbp), accounting for approximately 90% of the estimated genome size. The scaftig N50 of 31.2 kbp is similar to those of other high-quality genome assemblies such as potato and pepper. About 86% (362 Mbp) of the assembled genome is included in only 60 super-scaffolds anchored to the nine pseudomolecules. The longest superscaffold spans 30.2 Mb, 85% of chromosome 4 [1].</p>

<h3 id="genebuild">Annotation</h3>

<p>In assembly v1.0 gene annotation, 32,113 genes were predicted, of which 79% had substantial homology with known genes. The majority (98.7%) of gene predictions had supporting cDNA and/or EST evidence, demonstrating the high accuracy of gene prediction. Relative to five other closely related genomes, carrot was enriched for genes involved in a wide range of molecular functions. 564 tRNAs, 31 rRNA fragments, 532 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes, and 248 microRNAs (miRNAs) were also identified, distributed among 46 families.[1]</p>
