<h2 id="about">About <em>Beta vulgaris</em></h2>

<p>Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris ssp. vulgaris) is an important crop of temperate climates providing nearly 30% of the world's annual sugar production and a source for bioethanol and animal feed. The species belongs to the order of Caryophylalles, is diploid with 2n=18 chromosomes, has an estimated genome size of 714-758 Mbp and shares an ancient genome triplication with other eudicot plants. Leafy beets have been cultivated since Roman times, but sugar beet is one of the most recently domesticated crops [1].</p>

<p>The double haploid sugar beet line KWS2320 was sequenced using the Roche/454, Illumina and Sanger sequencing platforms. The initial assembly was integrated with genome-wide genetic and physical map information, resulting in 225 genetically anchored scaffolds (394.6 Mb), assigned to nine chromosomes. The final assembly comprised 566.6 Mbp in 2,171 scaffolds and 38,337 unscaffolded contigs. The N50 size was 2.01 Mb (the 72nd scaffold) and the chromosomally assigned fraction 84.7%. A total of 94% of the publicly available isogenic expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were located in the assembly, suggesting that gene-containing regions are comprehensively covered [1]</p>

<p>A total of 27,421 protein-coding genes supported by mRNA evidence were predicted; 91% included start and stop codons [1].</p>
