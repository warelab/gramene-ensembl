<h2 id="about">About <em>Musa acuminata</em></h2>

<p><em>Musa acuminata</em> (banana) is native to tropical South and Southeast Asia and is cultivated throughout the tropics. Grown primarily for its fruit, rich in starch, banana is the most popular fruit in industrialized countries. Cultivars mainly involve <em>Musa acuminata</em> (A-genome) and <em>Musa balbisiana</em> (B-genome) and are sometimes diploid but generally triploid. Banana is the first non-grass monocotyledon to be sequenced, making it an important genome for the comparative analysis of plants.</p>

<p>The genome sequence, assembly and protein coding genes annotation of the <em>Musa acuminata</em> ssp. malaccensis doubled-haploid genome have been generated by the <a href="http://www.musagenomics.org">Global Musa Genomics Consortium</a>, led jointly by the <a href="http://banana-genome.cirad.fr/">CIRAD</a> and the <a href="http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/spip/spip.php?lang=en">Genoscope</a>.</p>

<p>Its genome was released in July 2012 consisting of 24,425 contigs and 7,513 scaffolds with a total length of 472.2 Mbp, which represented 90% of the estimated DH-Pahang genome size. 70% of the assembly (332 Mbp) were anchored along the 11 Musa linkage groups of the Pahang genetic map.</p>
