<h2 id="about">About <em>Physcomitrella patens</em></h2>

<p>The mosses (<em>Bryophytes</em>) are non-vascular plants that appeared very early in the fossil record, soon after the transition of plants to terrestrial environments. The <em>Physcomitrella patens</em> genome is therefore valuable in understanding early evolution and adaptation of land plants. Physcomitrella also serves as a model organism for studies of physiology and development. Unlike in higher plants, targeted gene-knockouts can be made efficiently in the laboratory, thereby facilitating reverse-genetics approaches to studying gene function. The annotated genome hosted here thereby represents an important resource to the plant research community.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.phytozome.net/physcomitrella.php">Information from JGI:</a> The haploid genome of <em>Physcomitrella patens</em> ssp. patens ecotype Gransden 2004 is estimated to be ~480 Mbp contained in 27 pairs of chromosomes, and was sequenced to approximately 8.1x depth.</p>

<p>The genome assembly has remained unchanged since release v.1.1 (March 2007). Approximately 5.5 million shotgun reads were initially assembled using JAZZ. There are a total of 2,106 scaffolds, composed of 19,136 contigs, with a total length of ~480 Mbp. Half of the assembly is contained in 111 scaffolds, all at least 1.3 Mbp in length. The length-weighted mean contig size is 72.5 kbp.</p>

<p>Gene annotations are now updated to v1.6 from Cosmoss - The Physcomitrella patens resource. Annotations were originally made by JGI using a pipeline to predict and map gene models and associated transcripts/proteins using a variety of tools based on cDNA, protein homology and ab initio methods. The release v1.6 contains 32,272 gene models and 38,354 protein-coding transcripts. Scaffold and their associated gene models that were identified as contaminants in 2009 have been removed.</p>
