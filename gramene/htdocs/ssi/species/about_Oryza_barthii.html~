The genome of O. barthii (accession IRGC 105608) was sequenced and assembled by Arizona Genomics Institute (AGI). A whole genome shotgun sequencing approach was used to generate sequences using the following data inputs: 1) ~ 109X sequence coverage from 400bp fragment library using Illumina GAII; 2) ~100X physical coverage from each of 3kb and 8kb mate pair libraries using the Illumina HiSeq2000; and 3)  ~10X sequence  coverage from 800bp fragment library using Roche/454 FLX+. The genome was initially assembled using Allpaths-LG for Illumina sequences and Newbler for Roche FLX+ sequences followed by integration of the two assemblies using MINIMUS2. The order and orientation of the final scaffolds/contigs was confirmed using mate pair sequences, BAC end sequences and BAC physical map information followed by the construction of twelve pseudomolecules using software Genome Puzzle Master (GPM; in preparation). The final pseudomolecules contain 308Mb sequences with a scaffold N50 size of 25.8Mb (25,404 contigs with contig N50 size of 18.9kb).
