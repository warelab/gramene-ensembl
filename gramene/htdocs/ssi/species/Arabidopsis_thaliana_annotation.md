### Annotation

This browser is based on data from
[Araport11](https://www.araport.org/data/araport11) gene annotation, a
comprehensive reannotation of the TAIR10 genome, released June, 2016.
This annotation annotation was constructed using [113 public
RNA-seq](https://www.araport.org/113-rna-seq-sets-used-araport11) data
sets along with annotation contributions from NCBI, UniProt, and
laboratories conducting *Arabidopsis thaliana* research. Details of the
structural and functional annotation steps to generate the Araport11
protein-coding gene set as well as consolidation and annotation of
non-coding RNAs are described in <https://doi.org/10.1111/tpj.13415>.
