### Variation

Variation data from six different large scale studies are available:

1.  The [3000 Rice Genome
    Project](http://iric.irri.org/resources/3000-genomes-project)
    ([2015](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/24872877)), an
    international effort to sequence the genomes of 3,024 rice varieties
    from 89 countries providing 365,710 variant loci (SNPs and InDels).
2.  Whole genome sequencing of 104 elite rice cultivars ([Duitama *et
    al.* 2015](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/25923345)), described
    as, \"a comprehensive information resource for marker assisted
    selection\" providing 25,769,548 variant loci.
3.  Chip based analysis of 1,310 SNPs across 395 samples ([Zhao *et al*.
    2010](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/20520727)), described as,
    \"revealing the impact of domestication and breeding on the rice
    genome\".
4.  Chip based analysis of approximately 160k SNPs across 20 diversity
    rice accessions ([OryzaSNP](http://www.oryzasnp.org/), [McNally *et
    al*. 2009](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/19597147)), described
    as, \"revealing relationships among landraces and modern varieties
    of rice\".
5.  The [Oryza Map Alignment Project](http://www.omap.org/) (OMAP 2007):
    approximately 1.6M variant loci detected by comparing BAC End
    Sequences from four rice varieties to Japonica.
    \[[dbSNP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_viewTable.cgi?h=OMAP)\]
6.  Adaptive loss-of-function in domesticated rice ([BGI
    2004](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/15685292)): A collection of
    approximately 3M variant loci from the comparison of the Indica
    (93-11) and Japonica (Nipponbare) genomes.
    \[[dbSNP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_viewTable.cgi?pub=1049)\]

The following genetic markers were remapped to the IRGSP-1.0 assembly by
industry collaborator [KeyGene](http://www.keygene.com/):

-   20,483 Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL): 19,435 from [Gramene's legacy
    QTLs database](http://archive.gramene.org/qtl) and 1,048 from the
    [Q-Taro database](http://qtaro.abr.affrc.go.jp)
-   1,278 genetic markers (990 RFLPs and 288 SSRs) from [Gramene's
    legacy markers database](http://archive.gramene.org/markers)
