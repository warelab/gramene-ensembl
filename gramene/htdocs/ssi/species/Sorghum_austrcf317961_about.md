### About Sorghum AusTRCF317961
AusTRCF317961 is a wild *Sorghum bicolor* subsp. *verticilliflorum* accession which was collected when naturalised in an urban setting in South-East Queensland. It has been used as a CWR donor in multiple pre-breeding BCNAM populations â€“ both within the core Australian program and in introgression funded by the Global Crop Diversity Trust. In the core pre-breeding program significant CWR haplotype has persisted in subsequent pedigree breeding and selection for agronomic and trait performance.

The BCNAM populations from AusTRCF317961 have been used to study genetic architecture of grain weight, rust resistance and tillering.
