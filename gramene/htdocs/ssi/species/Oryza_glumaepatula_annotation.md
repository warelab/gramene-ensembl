### Annotation
Protein-coding gene annotation was performed with evidence-based MAKER-P genome annotation pipeline in CSHL.
### Gramene/Ensembl Genomes Annotation
Additional annotations generated by the Gramene project include:

* Gene phylogenetic trees with other Gramene species, [see example](https://oryza-ensembl.gramene.org/Oryza_glumaepatula/Gene/Compara_Tree?db=core;g=OGLUM01G00500;r=1:1-499999;t=OGLUM01G00500.1).
* Lastz Whole Genome Alignment to *Oryza sativa* Japonica, [see example](https://oryza-ensembl.gramene.org/Oryza_glumaepatula/Location/Compara_Alignments/Image?align=9264&db=core&r=1%3A225001-275000).
* Ortholog based [DAGchainer](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15247098) synteny detection against other AA genomes, [see example](https://oryza-ensembl.gramene.org/Oryza_glumaepatula/Location/Synteny?r=1:8001-18000).
* Mapping to the genome of multiple sequence-based feature sets using [gramene blat pipeline](http://docs.gramene.org/Blat_pipeline:_sequence_mapping_analysis), [see example](https://oryza-ensembl.gramene.org/Oryza_glumaepatula/Location/View?db=core;r=1:225001-275000).
* Identification of various repeat features from MIPS and AGI repeat libraries.
