### Assembly

The v3 *Populus* genome assembly was constructed with Arachne version
20071016HA with an attempt to merge the outbred haplotypes and an
extensive attempt to remove contaminating sequence. 81 Mb of finished
clone sequence was also integrated, and the latest genetic map
information to construct the 19 chromosome size scaffolds which contain
388 Mb of sequence, a majority of the assembled poplar sequence. Care
was taken to minimise alternative haplotypes within the assembly. The
first 19 scaffolds from the assembly correspond to the poplar
chromosomes. The full release covers 423 Mb of sequence with an average
read depth of 9.44x assembled sequence.
