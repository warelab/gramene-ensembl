### Variation

-   [The **Morris *et al***.
    set](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23267105) is from a 2013
    study of agroclimatic traits in *Sorghum*. In this study,
    approximately 265,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were
    characterised from 971 worldwide accessions, combining three
    previously defined sorghum diversity panels. They are: the US
    sorghum association panel (SAP), the sorghum mini core
    collection (MCC) and the Generation Challenge Program sorghum
    reference set (RS). GWAS studies were subsequently performed on
    plant height components and inflorescence architecture using 336 SAP
    lines. The data presented here represents the genotype information
    of the 378 SAP lines provided by the author.
-   [The **Mace *et al*.** SNPs
    set](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23982223) corresponds to
    6,578,420 SNPs (SNPs mapping to supercontigs were removed) genotyped
    in 45 *Sorghum bicolor* lines including the BTx623 reference genome
    plus 2 *S. propinquum* lines. The data was obtained by resequencing
    the genomes of the 44 *Sorghum bicolor* lines representing the
    primary gene pool and spanning dimensions of geographic origin,
    end-use and taxonomic group (i.e., major races of cultivated *S.
    bicolor*, landraces, improved inbreds, progenitors, wild and weedy),
    and the first resequenced genome of *S. propinquum*, all of which
    were mapped to the BTx623 S. *bicolor* reference genome.
-   The [Jiao EMS dataset](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/27354556)
    includes \~1.8 millions ethyl methane sulphonate (EMS)-induced G/C
    to A/T transition mutations annotated from 252 M3 families selected
    from the 6,400 sorghum mutant library in BTx623 background. Genomic
    DNA used for sequencing was pooled from 20 M3 plants per M2 family.

### Structural Variation

Data for structural variation in sorghum has been imported from the
[Database of Genomic Variants archive](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/dgva/)
(dGVA) from a single study containing around [32 thousand structural
variations](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22104744).
