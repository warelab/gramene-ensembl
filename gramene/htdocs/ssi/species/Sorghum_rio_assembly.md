### Assembly

The Sorghum Rio genome assembly was constructed by Cooper *et al* (2019) using FALCON (Chin *et al*, 2016) and polished with Quiver (Chin *et al*, 2013).

The Sorghum Rio v2.1 assembly in SorghumBase corresponds to release v2.0 of Phytozome. A total of 35,627 unique, non-repetitive, non-overlapping 1 KB sequences were generated using the existing Sorghum bicolor v3.0 assembly and aligned to the polished Sorghum Rio assembly. Scaffolds were oriented, ordered, and assembled into 10 chromosomes.
