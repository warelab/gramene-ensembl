<h2><strong>About</strong><strong> </strong><i><strong>Vitis vinifera L. ssp. vinifera </i></strong><strong>Pinot Noir PN40024 v4</strong></h2>

<p><i>Vitis vinifera</i> (grape) is the most widely cultivated and economically important grape species used for both eating and wine. It has a diploid genome with haploid chromosome number of 19, and an estimated genome size of ~500 Mb.</p>

<h2><strong>Assembly</strong></h2>

<p>This new assembly of PN40024 genotype, PN40024.v4, was performed with a hybrid strategy using 27X of Pacific Biosciences Sequel long-reads along with the PN12X scaffolds and 15X PN40024 Illumina paired-end resequencing data. We produced 640 scaffolds with a N50 size of 6.5Mb for a cumulative size of 474.5Mb. Compared to the PN12X.v2, the number of scaffolds was reduced by a factor of 3 and the N50 was doubled. Moreover, the number of unknown sequences, marked as N in the scaffold sequences, represents 1.8Mb and 0.4% of the assembly size versus 15.0Mb and 3.1% for PN12X.v2 scaffolds. Thus, PN40024.v4 is more contiguous and has more informative sequences than PN12X.v2. A total of 165 PN40024.v4 scaffolds were anchored to the 19 chromosomes, for a cumulative size of 462.1Mb. The 19 PN40024.v4 pseudomolecules are composed of 8.7 scaffolds on average. The assembly project was led by INRAE Grand-Est Colmar « Santé de la Vigne et Qualité du Vin » (Colmar, France).</p>

<h2><strong>Annotation</strong></h2>

<p>Protein-coding genes were predicted by combining the predictions and evidence data from GlimmerHMM, SNAP, BRAKER2 and GeneID ab initio gene prediction together with the lifted VCost.v3 annotation, stranded and unstranded transcriptome assemblies, a GFF file with aligned protein data (A. thaliana, eudicotyledone, Viridiplantae and Vitales protein sequences), the repeat annotation GFF file and the PN40024.v4 genome assembly using the software EvidenceModeler. After quality filtering, the gene models were finally processed by PASA to add the UTR regions and to calculate the alternatively spliced models. tRNAs were predicted with tRNAscan-SE-2.0. To retain the gene naming of the VCost.v3 gene models, a reciprocal best blast hit (RBH) strategy was carried out. Genes with a valid RBH were named according to the VCost.v3 gene, novel genes received the prefix ‘04’ at the start of the gene number and genes predicted for alternative heterozygous sequence regions received the suffix ‘_alt’. This new annotation was called PN40024.v4.1. A manual curation effort was initated using Apollo. The annotation project was undergone in the framework of the COST Action CA17111 Integrape.</p>
