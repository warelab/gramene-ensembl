### Assembly
Scientists from the University of Arizona, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, International Rice Research Institute, and Huazhong Agricultural University generated Oryza sativa cv. IRGC 128077 (variety cv. KETAN_NANGKA::IRGC_19961-2) genome high quality reference (n=12), which is one of the 16 PSRefSeqs and represents GJ-trop2 subpopulation.

The whole DNA was sequenced by >100 X PacBio Sequel cells. The genome assemblies were carried out by multiple assemblers, i.e. mecat2, canu and falcon. The pseudomolecule of each chromosome was constructed using the nucleotide sequence of multiple assemblies by Genome Puzzle Master by using Minghui63 as a guide. The final assembly was polished by >100 X PacBio corrected reads and > 100 X Illumina clean reads.
