About *Oryza nivara*
---------------------
*Oryza nivara* is a wild rice from India; one of rice species being used in the OMAP project. It belongs to the AA genome group. Breeders are interested in this organism because it exhibits resistance to grassy stunt virus. It is found in swampy areas, at edges of ponds and tanks, beside streams, in ditches, in or around rice fields. It usually grows in shallow water up to 0.3 m. seasonally dry; in open habitats. It has 12 chromosomes and a nuclear genome size of 448Mb (flow cytometry). This work was part of the Oryza Genome Evolution project funded by NSF Award #1026200 and in collaboration with Y. Hsing (Taiwan).
