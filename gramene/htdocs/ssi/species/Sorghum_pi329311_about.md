### About PI 329311
PI 329311 is a durra-type sorghum from Ethiopia that is one of the parental lines in the CP-NAM population (Boatwright et al. 2021). It was selected for this population because it was representative of East African genetic diversity. It is also known by the ICRISAT accession number IS 11069. This line was a top performer in terms of cellulosic biomass production in a series of trials performed at Clemson University.
