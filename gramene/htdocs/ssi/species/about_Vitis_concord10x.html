<h2><strong>About</strong><strong> </strong><i><strong>Vinis vinifera L. ssp. vinifera</i></strong><strong> </strong><strong>Vitis interspecific crossing Concord PI 588077</strong></h2><p>The <strong>Concord grape</strong> is a hybrid cultivar derived from the grape species <i>Vitis labrusca</i> (also known as fox grape) that are used as table grapes, wine grapes and juice grapes. They are often used to make grape jelly, grape juice, grape pies, grape-flavored soft drinks, and candy. The grape is sometimes used to make wine, particularly sacramental kosher wine. Traditionally, most commercially produced Concord wines have been finished sweet, but dry versions are possible if adequate fruit ripeness is achieved. The grape is named after the town in Massachusetts where it was developed.

Flame Seedless was prepared as a 10X Genomics library and sequenced to 49-fold coverage on an Illumina NovaSeq sequencer to generate linked-reads. The linked-read data were assembled using a Supernova assembler. The total length of the assembly is 491 Mbp with a scaffold N50 of 324 kbp.</p><h2><strong>Annotation</strong></h2><p>It is estimated that gene annotation was projected via alignment with the reference genome PN40024.</p><h2><strong>Regulation</strong></h2><p>N/A</p><h2><strong>Variation</strong></h2><p>N/A</p><h2><strong>References</strong></h2><p>Zou C, Karn A, Reisch B, Nguyen A, Sun Y et al.
