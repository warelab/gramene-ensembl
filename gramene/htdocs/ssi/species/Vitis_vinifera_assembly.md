### Assembly

This release is based on a 12x whole genome shotgun sequence assembly
and the V1 annotation of the *Vitis vinifera* genome. These data were
prepared by a French-Italian [Public Consortium for Grapevine Genome
Characterisation](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/17721507) under the
auspices of the [International Grape Genome Program
(IGGP)](https://www6.inrae.fr/iggp). Further details of the sequencing and
assembly are available from
[Genoscope](http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/spip/Vitis-vinifera-whole-genome.html).
