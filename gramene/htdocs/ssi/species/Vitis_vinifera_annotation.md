### Annotation

Protein-coding genes were predicted by combining *ab initio* models, *V.
vinifera* complementary DNA alignments, and alignments of proteins and
genomic DNA from other species. The integration of the data was
performed with [GAZE](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/gaze).

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipeline](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). There are: 1,106,465 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 63 Mb (13.0% of the genome); 282,465 RepeatMasker features (with the nrTEplants library), covering 225 Mb (46.4% of the genome); 130,283 RepeatMasker features (with the REdat library), covering 61 Mb (12.5% of the genome); 357303 Tandem repeats (TRF) features, covering 39 Mb (8.0% of the genome).
