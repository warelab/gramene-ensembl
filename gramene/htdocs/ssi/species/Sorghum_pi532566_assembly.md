### Assembly
The genome assembly of Sorghum PI532566 was reported in Tao et al. 2021. Sequencing was conducted by the Australia Sorghum breeding team in collaboration with BGI-Shenzhen using Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform and the PacBio Sequel platform to achieve 173X and 27X coverage, respectively. The assembly effort generated a genome of 643Mb with contigs N50 of 75.8kb.
