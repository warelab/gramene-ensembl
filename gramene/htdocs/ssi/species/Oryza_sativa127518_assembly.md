### Assembly
Scientists from the University of Arizona, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, International Rice Research Institute, and Huazhong Agricultural University generated *Oryza sativa* cv. IRGC 127518 (variety cv. KHAO_YAI_GUANG::IRGC_65972-1) genome high quality reference (n=12), which is one of the 16 PSRefSeqs and represents XI-3B1 subpopulation. The whole DNA was sequenced by >100 X PacBio Sequel cells. The genome assemblies were carried out by multiple assemblers, *i.e.* mecat2, canu and falcon. The pseudomolecule of each chromosome was constructed using the nucleotide sequence of multiple assemblies by Genome Puzzle Master by using Minghui63 as a guide. The final assembly was polished by >100 X PacBio corrected reads and > 100 X Illumina clean reads.
