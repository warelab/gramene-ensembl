### Assembly

The first genome assembly of *Sorghum bicolor* cv. Moench was [published
in 2009](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/19189423). Sequencing by the
US department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) [Community
Sequencing Program](http://www.jgi.doe.gov/CSP/) in collaboration with
the [Plant Genome Mapping Laboratory](http://www.plantgenome.uga.edu/)
followed a whole genome shotgun strategy reaching 8x coverage with
scaffolds, where possible, being assigned to the genetic map. Since then
JGI made two rounds of improvements. The most recent update of release
v3.0 includes \~351 Mb of finished sorghum sequence. A total of 349
clones were manually inspected, then finished and validated using a
variety of technologies. They were integrated into chromosomes by
aligning to v1.0 assembly. As a result, 4,426 gaps were closed, and a
total of 4.96 Mb of sequence was added to the assembly. Overall
contiguity (contig N50) increased by a factor of 5.8x from 204.5 Kb to
1.2 Mb. For more details, see
