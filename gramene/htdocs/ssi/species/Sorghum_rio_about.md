### About Sorghum bicolor Rio
*Sorghum bicolor* (L.) Moench subsp. bicolor, 'RIO' is an archetypal sweet sorghum line. In contrast to the current reference genome, the short-stature, early maturing inbred â€˜BTx623' genotype that is used primarily for production of grain sorghum hybrids, sweet sorghums differ in maturity and grain production, and are most notably characterized by their ability to produce a high concentration of soluble sugars in the stalk (concentrated stem sugars and high biomass yield), which can be extracted for human consumption.
