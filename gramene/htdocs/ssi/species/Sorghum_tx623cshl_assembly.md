### Assembly
The genome assembly of *Sorghum bicolor* cv. Moench was published in 2009 (Paterson et al, 2009). The present assembly corresponds to v3.1.1 at the US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) described in (McCormick et al, 2018), and is also known as the NCBIv3 assembly. Sequencing by the JGI's [Community Sequencing Program](http://www.jgi.doe.gov/user-programs/program-info/csp-overview/) in collaboration with the Plant Genome Mapping Laboratory at the University of Georgia, followed a whole-genome shotgun strategy reaching 8X coverage with scaffolds -where possible- being assigned to the genetic map. JGI did two additional rounds of improvements. The most recent update of release v3.0 included ~351 Mb of finished sorghum sequence. A total of 349 clones were manually inspected, then finished and validated using a variety of technologies including Sanger, 454 and Illumina. They were integrated into chromosomes by aligning to v1.0 assembly. As a result, 4,426 gaps were closed, and a total of 4.96 Mb of sequence was added to the assembly. Overall contiguity (contig N50) increased by a factor of 5.8X from 204.5 Kb to 1.2 Mb. For more details, see [Phytozome](https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Sbicolor_v3_1_1).
