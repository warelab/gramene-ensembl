### About *Sorghum bicolor* BTx623
*Sorghum bicolor* (L.) Moench subsp. bicolor, is a widely grown cereal crop, particularly in Africa, ranking 5th in global cereal production (FAOSTAT 2008; http://www.fao.org/in-action/inpho/crop-compendium/cereals-grains/). It is a C4 grass also used for sugar production, brewing, feedstock, and as a biofuel crop. Its diploid genome (~730 Mbp) has a haploid chromosome number of 10. The inbred variety ‘BTx623’ is the current reference genome for sorghum. It has short stature and an early maturing genotype used primarily to produce grain sorghum hybrids. It is a line susceptible to sugarcane aphid and sensitive to low nitrogen, and therefore often used in functional comparative studies.
