<h2 id="about">About <em>Nicotiana attenuata</em></h2>

<p>The pyridine alkaloid nicotine, whose addictive properties are well known to humans, is the signature compound of the genus Nicotiana (Solanaceae). In nature, nicotine is arguably one of the most broadly effective plant defense metabolites, in that it poisons acetylcholine receptors and is thereby toxic to all heterotrophs with neuromuscular junctions. Field studies using genetically modified <em>Nicotiana attenuata</em>(coyote tobacco) plants, an annual wild diploid native to western North America, have revealed that this toxin fulfills multifaceted ecological functions that contribute to plant fitness [1].</p>

<h3 id="assembly">Assembly</h3>

<p>The sequencing of the genome of N. attenuata was done using 30Ã— Illumina short reads, 4.5x 454 reads, and 10x PacBio single-molecule long reads. It was then assembled into 2.37 Gbp of sequences representing 92% of the expected genome size. From this was generated a 50x optical map and a high-density linkage map for super-scaffolding, which anchored 825.8 Mbp to 12 linkage groups and resulted in a final assembly with a N50 contig equal to 90.4 kbp and a scaffold size of 524.5 kb [1].</p>

<p>Using approximately 50x Illumina short reads, the Nicotiana obtusifolia genome was assembled with a 59.5 kbp and 134.1 kbp N50 contig and scaffold N50 size, respectively. The combined annotation pipeline integrating both hint-guided AUGUSTUS and MAKER2 gene prediction pipelines predicted 33,449 gene models in the <em>N. attenuata</em> genome. More than 71% of these gene models were fully supported by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) reads and 12,617 and 18,176 of these genes are orthologous to Arabidopsis and tomato genes, respectively [1].</p>
