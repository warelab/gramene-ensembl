About *Oryza sativa* Indica
---------------------
*Oryza sativa* Indica is one of the two most commonly cultivated sub-species of rice (along with [*O. sativa* Japonica](https://oryza-ensembl.gramene.org/Oryza_sativa)) and is the most widely grown in the hot climates of Southern Asia. The genome of Indica is very similar to that of Japonica, which is generally restricted to temperate climes such as Japan.
