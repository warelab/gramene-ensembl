### **About Chinese Amber [PI 22913]**

Chinese Amber was one of the first commercially produced sorghum lines ever introduced into the U.S. in 1853. It is a historically sweet sorghum that is primarily used for syrup production rather than sucrose extraction. It is also one of the more genetically distinct sorghum varieties that can be used for biofuel production, which is why it was selected as one of the parents for the CP-NAM population (Boatwright *et al*, 2021).
