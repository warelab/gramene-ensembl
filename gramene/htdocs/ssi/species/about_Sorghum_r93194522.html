<h2>About Sorghum R931945-2-2</h2>

<p>R931945-2-2 is an <i>S.bicolor</i> breeding line developed and owned by the Queensland Government, Australia. It is the product of successful selection to develop lines with resistance to sorghum midge and stay-green type drought resistance. It is a restorer of fertility in the A1 male-sterile cytoplasm. R931945-2-2 has a complex pedigree that includes the stay-green donor, Tx642, at several points and multiple donors of midge resistance including TAM2566, SC165-14E, AF28 and BTx2754. </p>
<p>R931945-2-2 has been used repeatedly as the adapted recurrent parent in the development of extensive BCNAM populations by the Australian core pre-breeding program. It has also been an important parent in the development of restorer lines in multiple commercial grain sorghum breeding programs.</p>

<h2>Assembly</h2>

<p>The genome assembly of Sorghum R931945-2-2 was reported in Tao <i>et al</i>, 2021. Sequencing was conducted by the Australia Sorghum breeding team in collaboration with BGI-Shenzhen using Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform and the PacBio Sequel platform to achieve 179X and 29X coverage, respectively. The assembly effort generated a genome of 599.2Mb with contigs N50 of 116.5kb.</p>


<h2>Annotation</h2>

<p>Gene prediction was performed using a hybrid approach combining de novo gene predictors and evidence-based methods (Tao et al, 2021), which led to the identification of 33,567 genes in the genome.</p>
