About *Zea mays*
----------------

Maize or *Zea mays* had the highest world-wide production 
of all grain crops in [2019](http://faostat.fao.org).
Although a food staple in many regions of the world, most is used for
animal feed and ethanol fuel. Maize was domesticated from wild teosinte
in Central America and its cultivation spread throughout the Americas by
Pre-Columbian civilisations. In addition to its economic value, maize is
an important model organism for studies in plant genetics, physiology,
and development. It has a large genome of about 2.4 gigabases with a
haploid chromosome number of 10 (2n=2x=20) [2-4]. Maize is
distinguished from other grasses in that its genome arose from an
ancient tetraploidy event unique to its lineage.
This sequence corresponds to inbred line B73.
