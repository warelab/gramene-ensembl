About *Oryza brachyantha*
--------------------
*Oryza brachyantha* (wild rice) is a distant relative of cultivated rice ([*O. satia Japonica*](https://oryza-ensembl.gramene.org/Oryza_sativa) and [*O. sativa Indica*](https://oryza-ensembl.gramene.org/Oryza_indica)). It is placed on the basal lineage of *Oryza* and is the only member of the genus assigned to the F-genome type. An annual or weekly perennial tufted grass, it is distributed in west and central Africa, and grows in open wetland habitats. It has potentially useful traits for rice breeding, including resistance/tolerance to [yellow stem borer](http://www.knowledgebank.irri.org/ipm/stem-borer/stem-borer-species/yellow-stem-borer.html), [leaffolder](http://www.knowledgebank.irri.org/RiceDoctor/information-sheets-mainmenu-2730/pests-mainmenu-2737/rice-leaffolder-mainmenu-2816.html), [whorl maggot](http://www.knowledgebank.irri.org/RiceDoctor/information-sheets-mainmenu-2730/pests-mainmenu-2737/rice-whorl-maggot-mainmenu-2819.html) and [bacterial blight](http://www.knowledgebank.irri.org/RiceDoctor/information-sheets-mainmenu-2730/diseases-mainmenu-2735.html). The *O. brachyantha* genome provides an important resource for functional and evolutionary studies in the genus Oryza. Its nuclear genome is diploid (2n = 24) and ~362 Mbp.
