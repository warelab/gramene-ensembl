### Annotation
Protein-coding gene annotation was performed with evidence-based MAKER-P genome annotation pipeline at CSHL.

### Gramene/Ensembl Genomes Annotation
Additional annotations generated by the Gramene and Ensembl Plants project include:

* Gene phylogenetic trees with other Gramene species, [see example](https://oryza-ensembl.gramene.org/Oryza_barthii/Gene/Compara_Tree?g=OBART01G00010;r=1:3176-11190).
* Lastz Whole Genome Alignment to *Arabidopsis thaliana*, *Oryza sativa* Japonica (IRGSP v1) and other *Oryza* AA genomes, [see example](https://oryza-ensembl.gramene.org/Oryza_barthii/Location/Compara_Alignments/Image?align=9269&db=core&r=1%3A8001-18000).
* Ortholog based [DAGchainer](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15247098) synteny detection against other AA genomes, [see example](https://oryza-ensembl.gramene.org/Oryza_barthii/Location/Synteny?r=1:8001-18000).
* Mapping to the genome of multiple sequence-based feature sets using [gramene blat pipeline](http://docs.gramene.org/Blat_pipeline:_sequence_mapping_analysis), [see example](https://oryza-ensembl.gramene.org/Oryza_barthii/Location/View?r=1:8001-18000).
* Identification of various repeat features by programs such as RepeatMasker with MIPS and AGI repeat libraries, and Dust, TRF.
