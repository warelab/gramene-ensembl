A minimum tiling path of <a href="http://www.genome.arizona.edu/orders/direct.html?library=OM_ABa">181 BAC clones</a> was selected across the short arm of chromosome 3 of Oryza meridionalis using <a href="http://www.omap.org/fpc/WebAGCoL/OM_ABa/WebFPC/">a heavily manually edited physical map</a>. The BACs were divided into six 3Mb pools and sequenced using Roche GSFLX+ chemistry (shotgun and paired-end reads) to a depth of 26X. Sequence reads were assembled with Newbler v2.6 (Roche 454) followed by order and orientation of the assembled scaffolds and contigs using Genome Puzzle Master (GPM) software (Zhang and Wing. unpublished). The assembly resulted in a single scaffold of 18,483,162 bp with 885 contigs.

<p>These pre-publication data are being released under guidelines of <a href="http://www.genome.gov/10506537">the Fort Lauderdale Agreement</a>, which reaffirms the balance between fair use (i.e. no pre-emptive publication) and early disclosure. Users are encouraged use these data to advance their research on individual loci but are asked to respect the rights of the investigators who generated these data to publish the whole-genome level description of the <em>O. brachyantha</em> in a peer-reviewed journal. This description includes whole-genome comparative analyses, genome size evolution, gene family evolution, gene organization and movement, heterochromatin, centromere evolution.
