### Assembly

The 121 Mb draft sequence of the Chlamydomonas nuclear genome was
generated at 13x coverage by whole-genome, shotgun sequencing of plasmid
and fosmid libraries, followed by assembly into \~1500 contigs [by
JGI](https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html#!info?alias=Org_Creinhardtii).
Assembly into chromosomes was done on the basis of genetic mapping.
