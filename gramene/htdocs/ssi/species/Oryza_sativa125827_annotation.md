### Annotation
Done by Ware Lab researchers at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Initial protein-coding genes were generated with the MAKER-P pipeline (Campbell *et al*, 2014) using line-specific RNA-seq transcript and full-length transcripts from Zhou *et al* (2020). Non-overlapping ab initio models were added using SNAP (Korf, 2004), Augustus (Stanke *et al*, 2008), and FGENESH (Soovyev *et al*, 2006) gene predictors. The combined gene models were improved for structure including UTR extensions using line-specific full-length transcripts and rice ESTs from GenBank. Final models were quality checked using GFF3toolkit (Chen *et al*, 2019) and canonical transcripts assigned with TRaCE (Olson and Ware, 2020).
