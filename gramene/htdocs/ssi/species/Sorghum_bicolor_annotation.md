### Annotation

This browser presents data from the v3.0.1 assembly and v3.1.1 gene set
(March 2007). Gene prediction is an improved process based upon
resources used in original v1.0 release (Sbi1 assembly and Sbi1.4 gene
set) with new geneAtlas RNA-seq data. Read more at

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature
pipeline](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). There
are: six classes of repeats loaded from (ENA); 685,783 Low complexity
(Dust) features, covering 29 Mb (4.0% of the genome); 455,749
RepeatMasker features (with the RepBase library), covering 451 Mb (62.1%
of the genome); 392,778 RepeatMasker features (with the REdat library),
covering 409 Mb (56.2% of the genome); and 245,654 Tandem repeats (TRF)
features, covering 41 Mb (5.7% of the genome).
