### Variation
19,435,202 SNPs called for this [Magic16](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0438-2) genome that is part of the [3000 rice genome project](https://doi.org/10.1186/2047-217x-3-7) by Dr. Rod Wing's group from resequencing reads using [GATK4](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us) software.

Large structural variation of 16 PSRefSeqs are available (including map to IRGC117425):

1. A platinum standard pan-genome resource that represents the population structure of Asian rice (Zhou *et al*, 2020)(https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0438-2), as described as “natural variation that exists in the pan-genome of cultivated Asian rice”.
