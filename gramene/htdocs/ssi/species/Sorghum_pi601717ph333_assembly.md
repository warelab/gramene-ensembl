### Assembly

DNA extraction, sequencing and assembly: High molecular weight (HMW) DNA from young-fresh leaves were extracted and used for long reads using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) ligation-based libraries (SQK-LSK109). Final libraries were loaded on an ONT flowcell (v9.4.1) and run on the PromethION. Illumina 2x150 paired-end reads were also generated for polishing genome assemblies. Short reads libraries were prepared from HMW DNA using Illumina NexteraXT library prep kit, and sequenced on NextSeq High Output 300 cycle, paired end 2X150 kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). ONT reads were assembled using Flye (v2.9.2) then polished using Racon (v1.5.0) and Pilon (v1.24) with Illumina reads. Ragtag (v2.1.0) was used to scaffold the contigs. The completeness of the genome assembly was assessed through BUSCO (v. 5.4.3).
