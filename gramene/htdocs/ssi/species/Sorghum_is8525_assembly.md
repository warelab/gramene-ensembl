### Assembly
The genome assembly of Sorghum IS8525 was reported in Tao et al. 2021. Sequencing was conducted by the Australia Sorghum breeding team in collaboration with BGI-Shenzhen using Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform and the PacBio Sequel platform to achieve 176X and 39X coverage, respectively. The assembly effort generated a genome of 569Mb with contigs N50 of 402.3kb.
