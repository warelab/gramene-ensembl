About PI 562623 
---------------------
Sorghum bicolor, a diploid cereal crop with a genome size of approximately 730 Mb and 10 haploid chromosomes, is the fifth most produced cereal worldwide (Paterson et al., 2009). Primarily cultivated in Africa, sorghum is also recognized for its potential as a biofuel crop and a source of cellulosic feedstock (George et al., 2022). Its relatively compact genome makes sorghum an excellent model for functional genomics studies of Saccharinae and other C4 grasses.

In the United States, Plant Variety Protection (PVP) laws safeguard inbred sorghum lines developed by private companies for 20 years. After this period, these lines, known as ex-PVPs, become publicly accessible, providing valuable genetic resources for breeding programs aimed at enhancing yield, disease resistance, and climate resilience
