### Assembly
The *Sorghum bicolor* Tx430 genome was generated by combining Oxford Nanopore sequences generated on a MinION sequencer with Bionano Genomics Direct Label and Stain (DLS) optical maps, as described by Deschamps *et al* (2018)(see also https://www.corteva.com). The final chromosome-scale de novo assembly consists of 29 scaffolds, encompassing mostly entire chromosome arms. It has a scaffold N50 of 33.28 Mbps, and covers 90% of the expected genome length.
