### Assembly
The genome assembly of Sorghum Ji2731 was reported in Tao *et al* (2021). Sequencing was conducted by the Australia Sorghum breeding team in collaboration with BGI-Shenzhen using Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform and the PacBio Sequel platform to achieve 160X and 35X coverage, respectively. The assembly effort generated a genome of 703.8Mb with contigs N50 of 3.5Mb.
