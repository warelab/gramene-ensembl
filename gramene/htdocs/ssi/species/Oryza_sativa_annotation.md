### Annotation

International Rice Genome Sequencing Project (IRGSP) gene models were
imported from the Rice Annotation Project
([RAP-DB](http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp)). The most recent update was
from its 26th November 2018 release. This version corrected gene models
with manual curation, also deprecated some bad models. In total, 35,666
protein-coding genes were included. Feature annotation and comparative
analysis pipelines have been run and variations have been projected from
the old annotation to the new one.

[MSU-7](http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/home_overview.shtml) gene
models were also loaded for visual comparison to the IRGSP set. Cross
references between the two gene sets provided by
[RAP-DB](http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp) allow searching and querying
using either identifier space, but only the IRGSP/RAPDB models are used
in our gene trees.
