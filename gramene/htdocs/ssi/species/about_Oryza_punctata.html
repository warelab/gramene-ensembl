  About <i>Oryza punctata</i>
</h2>

<p> <i>Oryza punctata</i> is an annual wild rice classified in the BB genome group, within genus Oryza. It has 12 chromosomes with an estimated genome size of 425 Mb. It is native to tropical Africa and Madagascar, and it naturally grows in flooded watercourses, stream banks, pond margins and rice fields. The accession (IRGC 105690) selected for sequencing contains important stress tolerance traits such as shade tolerance, resistances to stem rot, brown planthopper, whorl maggot, and zigzag leafhopper, and those traits could be used to improve cultivated rice. <i>O. punctata</i> can also serve as a close outgroup in evolutionary analyses of AA genome group species, which contain two cultivated rice (<i>O. sativa</i> and <i>O. glaberrima</i>) and their progenitor species (<i>O. rufipogon</i> and <i>O. barthii</i>).

  Assembly of BB whole genome
</h3>

<p>Whole genome sequences were prepared using Roche/454 and Illumina methods at 20x and 100x coverage respectively.  Three large insert Mate Pair (MP) libraries were sequenced using Illumina methods as follows: chromosome specific 3kb MP library derived from about 3628 MTP BACs, whole genome 10kb and 20kb MP libraries. Two independent assemblies were produced using newbler for the 454 data and AllPaths-LG for Illumina data, then the two assemblies were merged using minimus2. Finally Genome Puzzle Master (GPM) was used to order/orient contigs/scaffolds and make chromosome pseudomolecules. Project funding: National Science Foundation Plant Genome Research Program (#1026200) awarded to R. Wing, D. Ware, M. Sanderson, M. Long, C. Machado and S. Jackson
