### Assembly
The genome assembly of Sorghum IS19953 was reported in Tao et al, 2021. Sequencing was conducted by the Australia Sorghum breeding team in collaboration with BGI-Shenzhen using Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform and the PacBio Sequel platform to achieve 172X and 34X coverage, respectively. The assembly effort generated a genome of 600Mb with contigs N50 of 385.2kb.
