About *Sorghum bicolor*
-----------------------

*Sorghum bicolor* is a widely grown cereal crop, particularly in Africa,
ranking 5th in global cereal production. It is also used as biofuel crop
and potential cellulosic feedstock. The diploid genome (\~730 Mb) has a
haploid chromosome number of 10. Although highly repetitive, the genome
is more tractable for sequencing than its close relative, *[Zea
mays](/zea_mays "Zea mays in Ensembl Plants")*.
