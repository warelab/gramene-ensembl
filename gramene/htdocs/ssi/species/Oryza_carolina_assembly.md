### Assembly
Sequencing was performed using PacBio technology as deascribed in Vaughn *et al* (2021). Raw PacBio reads (n = 3,765,107; ~70x coverage) were assembled into 209 contigs, using Canu (v1.5)(Koren *et al*, 2017), and polished with Quiver (smrtlink v5.0.1 suite, now at github.com/PacificBiosciences/GenomicConsensus). PacBio raw reads were further polished with pilon v1.22 (Walker *et al*, 2017) using "10X Genomics" linked-reads aligned by Longranger v2.1.6 (github.com/10XGenomics/longranger). Repeat masking was performed as part of the MAKER-P pipeline (Campbell *et al*, 2014) using custom repeat libraries, PReDa_121015_short.fasta (DNA) and TE_protein_db_121015_short_header.fasta (protein)(Stein *et al*, 2018; Copetti *et al*, 2015).
