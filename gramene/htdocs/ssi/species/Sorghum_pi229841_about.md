### About PI 229841
PI 229841 is a sorghum line that was chosen as one of the parents in the Carbon Partitioning NAM (CP-NAM) population (Boatwright et al. 2021). It is also known by the ICRISAT accession number IS 2382. This line was selected as a representative Kafir genotype, which is the sorghum race that historically originates from southern Africa and is more temporally adapted than other sorghum landraces. PI 229841 was selected in particular because it was the tallest kafir sorghum in the Bioenergy Association Panel (BAP) (Brenton et al. 2016).
