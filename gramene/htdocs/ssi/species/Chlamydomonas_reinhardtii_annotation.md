### Annotation

The set of gene predictions in version 5.5 incorporates [JGI gene
expression
data](https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html#!info?alias=Org_Creinhardtii)
from 1 million reads generated from nitrogen-starved cells on the 454
Titanium platform as well as 239 million 2x150 stranded Illumina reads
and other smaller RNA-seq datasets. The underlying gene prediction was
performed by [Mario
Stanke](https://math-inf.uni-greifswald.de/en/department/about-us/employees/prof-dr-mario-stanke-english/)
using Augustus (annotation version u11.6).

Additional analysis was carried out in house: non coding RNA genes have
been annotated using
[tRNAScan-SE](http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC146525),
[Rfam](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/15608160), and
[RNAmmer](http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC1888812).
