### Assembly
The genome sequence was generated and assembled by the Arizona Genomics Institute (AGI) using accession IRGC105164. Illumina reads of different library sizes were assembled with Allpaths-LG and gaps were closed with GapFiller. The estimated coverage from the WGS was 150x. Total sequence length is 266,687,832 bp; Number of contigs is 10,288; Contig N50: 48,151bp.
