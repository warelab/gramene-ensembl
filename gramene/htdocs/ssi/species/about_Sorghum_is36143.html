<h2>About <i>Sorghum bicolor </i>ssp. <i>bicolor </i>IS 3614-3</h2>

<p>IS 3614-3 is one of three selections made within the variation exhibited by IS 3614 when the introduction was grown in Australia. </p>
<p>IS 3614 is a landrace of <i>Sorghum bicolor</i> called Akooil, also designated BE 13. It was collected from the Zaria province (11.039999, 7.42/ in Nigeria. It belongs to the <i>guinea</i> race and the informal intra-racial taxon <i>conspicuum.</i> Selection IS 3614-3 has been used as the donor parent in a BCNAM population in the core Australian program. </p>

<h2>Assembly</h2>

<p>The genome assembly of Sorghum IS 3614-3 was reported in Tao <i>et al</i>. Sequencing was conducted by the Australia Sorghum breeding team in collaboration with BGI-Shenzhen using Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform and the PacBio Sequel platform to achieve 172X and 44X coverage, respectively. The assembly effort generated a genome of 631Mb with contigs N50 of 253.5kb. </p>



<h2>Annotation</h2>

<p>Gene prediction was performed using a hybrid approach combining de novo gene predictors and evidence-based methods (Tao <i>et al</i>, 2021), which led to the identification of 34,366 genes in the genome.</p>
