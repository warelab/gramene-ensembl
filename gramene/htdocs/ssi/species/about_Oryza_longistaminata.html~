A sequence assembly of the short arm of chromosome 3 of O. longistaminata, derived from whole genome shotgun sequence data, was generated as follows. A whole genome shotgun assembly (i.e. Illumina sequence, SOAP de novo assembly) of O. longistaminata was generated by Professor Wen Wang (Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China) in collaboration with BGI-Shenzhen, China. The genome assembly was composed of 135,973 scaffolds spanning 344.6Mb with a N50 scaffold size of 62.4kb. Using this assembly, the Arizona Genomics Institute (AGI) selected scaffolds and contigs that were syntenic to the short arm of chromosome 3 of O. sativa ssp.japonica, and the order and orientation of each scaffold/contig was confirmed using Genome Puzzle Mater software (GPM, unpublished) to produce a Chr3S pseudomoleclue. The final O. longistaminata chromosome 3 short arm resulted in a single scaffold of 14,404,039bp composed of 4,724 contigs.
