A minimum tiling path of BAC clones was selected across the short arm of chromosome 3 of each of the Oryza minuta BB and CC subgenomes using a heavily manually edited physical map. BAC clones were shotgun Sanger sequenced to 8x coverage and phase II finished. Assembly of the tile sequence was performed manually.
