### Assembly

The B73 genome was sequenced to high depth using PacBio long-read technology 
together with 25 founder inbred lines strategically selected to represent the 
breadth of maize diversity including lines from temperate, tropical, sweet corn, 
and popcorn germplasm. All lines were assembled into contigs using a hybrid approach, 
corrected with long-read and Illumina short-read data, scaffolded using Bionano optical maps
and ordered into pseudomolecules using linkage data from the NAM recombinant inbred lines 
and maize pan-genome anchor markers. The 26 lines were also annotated with a common pipeline.

The current assembly is named Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0 and was aligned to the previous 
B73_RefGen_v4 version with software ATAC/A2Amapper [5], obtaining 96.76% mapped positions. 
Those mappings can be used to translate coordinates across with the
