### **About Grassl [PI 154844]**

Grassl is a historic sorghum breeding line released in 1984. It is classified as a sweet sorghum, meaning it has the ability to accumulate high concentrations of stalk sugars during development, but this line also produces a large amount of plant biomass, which is why is it was selected as the recurrent parent in the Carbon Partitioning NAM (CP-NAM) population (Boatwright et al. 2021). It is known to be highly resistant to multiple diseases, including anthracnose. It is named after the famous plant explorer Carl O. Grassl.
