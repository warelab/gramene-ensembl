### Variation
About 32.5 million SNPs were called in 400 SAP lines by Rod Wing's group with the HPC-based AFW-GVC/GATK4 pipeline [Yong Zhou, Nagarajan Kathiresan and Rod A. Wing (2023), manuscript in preparation], and are now available from the Tx2783 genome browser. See for example [4_6047465_C_T](https://ensembl.sorghumbase.org/Sorghum_tx2783pac/Variation/Sample?db=core;r=4:6046965-6047965;v=4_6047465_C_T;vdb=variation;vf=11387812), a SNP predicted to introduce a STOP codon and result in a truncated [SbiRTX2783.04G076100](https://ensembl.sorghumbase.org/Sorghum_tx2783pac/Gene/Summary?db=core;g=SbiRTX2783.04G076100;r=4:6046424-6048133;t=SbiRTX2783.04G076100.1;v=4_6047465_C_T;vdb=variation;vf=11387812) protein product.
