### About Sorghum PI536008
PI536008 is a wild *Sorghum* accession from near Waza (11.2500, 14.6667), Maroua, Extreme-Nord Province in Cameroon. It is classified in GRIN as *S.purpureosericeum*. One botanist (Bryan Simon) at the Queensland Herbarium questioned this classification, contending it is more likely S.bicolor. PI536008 appears to be fully interfertile with cultivated sorghum and it has been used as a CWR parent in both the Queensland core pre-breeding program and the sorghum CWR BCNAM panel supported by the Global Crop Diversity Trust. Prior to its donation to the USDA collection, it was designated TCD070 by IBPGR.
