<!-- {about} --><a name="about"></a>
<p>Bread wheat or common wheat (<em>Triticum aestivum</em>) is a major worldwide cereal grain which is essential to human food. Wheat was one of the first cereals to be domesticated, and is thought to have originated in the fertile crescent around 9000 years B.C.</p>
<p>Bread wheat species is hexaploid, and its genome size is estimated at 17Gbp. It is composed of three closely-related and independently maintained genomes. Bread wheat is the result of a series of hybridization events that are thought to have occurred naturally. The ancestral progenitor genomes are considered to be <em>Triticum urartu</em> (the A genome donor), and an unknown grass, but thought to be closely related to <em>Aegilops speltoides</em> (the B genome donor). This first hybridization event produced tetraploid emmer wheat (AABB, <em>T. dicoccoides</em>), which then hybridized with a diploid goat grass (DD, <em>Aegilops tauschii</em>).</p>

<h2>Assemblies</h2>
<p>Chromosome survey sequences for bread wheat cv Chinese Spring have been generated by the <a href="http://www.wheatgenome.org/">International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium</a>. <a href="http://www.tgac.ac.uk/">The Genome Analysis Centre </a>has provided an assembly of these survey sequences, which is now available through Ensembl Plants. ~11 millions contigs and ~10 millions scaffolds were generated with a contig N50 of 2.4kb. Due to the large number of scaffolds, we have only loaded a subset, comprising all scaffolds equal or greater than 3kb and additionnally, all scaffolds to which wheat cDNA alignments have been made (leading to a total of ~710,000 scaffolds loaded in the database). The set of scaffolds that was loaded has been included in the <a href="http://plants.ensembl.org/Triticum_aestivum/blastview">Ensembl Plants BLAST</a> and <a href="http://dev.ensemblgenomes.org/node/ENA%20search">ENA search</a> facilities.</p>
<p>The complete set of survey sequences may be downloaded from <a href="http://opendata.tgac.ac.uk/iwgsc/css/v1/">The Genome Analysis Centre</a>, and can be searched using the <a href="http://tgac-browser.tgac.ac.uk/iwgsc_css/blast.jsp">TGAC blast server</a>. The data will be available shortly in the archives of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Consortium.</p>

<h2>Annotations</h2>
<p>The predicted gene annotations come from <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/%7Eguy/exonerate/">Exonerate</a> alignments of wheat coding sequences (CDS) from two sets of transcripts: <em>Triticum turgidum</em> assembled RNAseq data (Genome Biology 2013, 14:R66, Supplemental dataset 7) and a collection of publicly available wheat transcripts filtered to exclude pseudogenes, sequences shorter than 90 bp, and ORFs similar to those present in the <em>T. turgidum</em> set. See <a href="http://maswheat.ucdavis.edu/Transcriptome/">Triticeae-CAP</a> project page for more information.<br />The program findorf was used to predict the CDS within these transcripts as described in [2].</p>

<p>As part of the wheat genome analysis, we have aligned a set of identified <em>Triticum aestivum</em> gene sequences and homoeologous SNPs (SNPs between the component A, B, and D genomes of wheat) against the <em>Brachypodium distachyon</em> and barley (<em>Hordeum vulgare</em>) genomes [1]. <br />Currently, the size and complexity of the wheat genome precludes a chromosome-scale assembly. However, significant sequences resources have been used to produce a gene-space assembly, included here in the syntenic context of <em>brachypodium distachyon</em>, a model cereal and pooid relative of wheat, as well as of barley. Sequences of diploid progenitor and ancestral species permitted homoeologous SNPs to be classified into two groups, 1) SNPs that differ between the A and D genomes (where the B genome is unknown) and, 2) SNPs that are the same between the A and D genomes, but differ in B.</p>
<p>The wheat gene alignments and the projected wheat SNPs are available on the Location view of the <em>Brachypodium distachyon</em> and <em>Hordeum vulgare</em> genomes, as additional tracks under the "Wheat SNPs and alignments" section of the "Configure This page" menu. <a title="Example wheat gene alignments and homoeologous SNPs" href="http://test.plants.ensembl.org/Brachypodium_distachyon/Location/View?db=core;r=5:2580560-2583709;contigviewbottom=Lastz_Wheat_A_subsequences_alignments=normal,Lastz_Wheat_B_subsequences_alignments=normal,Lastz_Wheat_D_subsequences_alignments=normal,Lastz_Wheat_X_subsequences_alignments=normal,simple_core_wheat_snp_a=normal,simple_core_wheat_snp_b=normal">Click here for a <em>Brachypodium</em> example</a>. <a href="http://test.plants.ensembl.org/Hordeum_vulgare/Location/View?db=core;r=1:279279843-279283843;contigviewbottom=Lastz_Wheat_A_subsequences_alignments=normal,Lastz_Wheat_B_subsequences_alignments=normal,Lastz_Wheat_D_subsequences_alignments=normal,Lastz_Wheat_X_subsequences_alignments=normal,simple_core_wheat_snp_a=normal,simple_core_wheat_snp_b=normal">Click here for a barley example</a>.</p>
