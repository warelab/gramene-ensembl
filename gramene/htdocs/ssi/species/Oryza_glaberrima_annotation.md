### Annotation
Protein-coding genes were annotated with MAKER-P software in CSHL.
### Gramene/Ensembl Genomes Annotation
Additional annotations generated by the Gramene project include:
* Gene phylogenetic trees with other Gramene species, [see example](https://oryza-ensembl.gramene.org/Oryza_glaberrima/Gene/Compara_Tree?g=ORGLA12G0072100;r=12:6645096-6649987;t=ORGLA12G0072100.1).
* Lastz Whole Genome Alignment to *Arabidopsis thaliana*, *Oryza sativa* Japonica (IRGSP v1), and a few AA oryza genomes, [see example](https://oryza-ensembl.gramene.org/Oryza_glaberrima/Location/Compara_Alignments/Image?align=9160&db=core&r=1%3A8001-18000).
* Ortholog based [DAGchainer](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15247098) synteny detection against other AA genomes, [see example](https://oryza-ensembl.gramene.org/Oryza_glaberrima/Location/Synteny?r=1:8001-18000).
* Mapping to the genome of multiple sequence-based feature sets using gramene blat pipeline, see example.
* Identification of various repeat features from MIPS and AGI repeat libraries.
* Variation effect prediction with sequence ontology, [for example](https://oryza-ensembl.gramene.org/Oryza_glaberrima/Variation/Explore?r=12:18785206-18786206;v=tmp_12_18785706;vdb=variation;vf=4432574).
