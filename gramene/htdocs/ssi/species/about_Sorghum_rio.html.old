<h2 id="about">About <em>Sorghum bicolor Rio</em></h2>

<p><em>Sorghum bicolor Rio</em> is an archetypal sweet sorghum line. In contrast to the current reference genome, the short-stature, early maturing inbred â€˜BTx623' genotype that is used primarily for production of grain sorghum hybrids, sweet sorghums differ in maturity and grain production, and are most notably characterized by their ability to produce a high concentration of soluble sugars in the stalk (concentrated stem sugars and high biomass yield), which can be extracted for human consumption.

<h3 id="assembly">Assembly</h3>

<p>The Sorghum Rio genome assembly was constructed by Cooper et al (2019) [1] using FALCON (Chin et al, 2016) and polished with Quiver (Chin et al, 2013). Genome-guided transcript assemblies were made from close to 1 billion bp of 2x151bp paired-end Illumina RNA-Seq reads using PERTRAN (Shu, unpublished). PASA (Haas et al, 2008) alignment assemblies were constructed using the PERTRAN output from the Rio RNA-Seq data along with sequences from known <i>S. bicolor</i> expressed sequence tags (ESTs) associated with the current reference genome. This current Sorghum Rio v2.1 assembly corresponds to release v2.0 of Phytozome. A total of 35,627 unique, non-repetitive, non-overlapping 1 KB sequences were generated using the existing Sorghum bicolor v3.0 assembly and aligned to the polished Sorghum Rio assembly. Scaffolds were oriented, ordered, and assembled into 10 chromosomes.

<p> As described in Phytozome, transcript assemblies for Sorghum Rio v2.1 were made by Cooper et al (2019) [1] from close to 1 billion pairs of 2X151 paired-end Illumina RNA-Seq reads using PERTRAN (Shu, unpublished). 71,005 transcript assemblies were constructed using PASA (Haas et al, 2008) from Sorghum bicolor Sanger ESTs and RNA-Seq transcript assemblies. Loci were determined by transcript assembly alignments and/or EXONERATE alignments of proteins from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, soybean, maize, rice, foxtail, <i>Sorghum bicolor</i> BTx623, brachy, grape, and Swiss-Prot proteomes to the repeat-soft-masked <i>Sorghum bicolor Rio</i> genome using RepeatMasker (Smit, 1996-2012) with up to 2K BP extension on both ends unless extending into another locus on the same strand. Gene models were predicted by homology-based predictors, FGENESH+ (Salamov and Solovyev, 2000), FGENESH_EST (similar to FGENESH+, EST as splice site and intron input instead of protein/translated ORF), and GenomeScan (Yeh et al, 2001), PASA assembly ORFs (in-house homology constrained ORF finder) and from AUGUSTUS via BRAKER1 (Hoff et al, 2015). The best scored predictions for each locus are selected using multiple positive factors including EST and protein support, and one negative factor: overlap with repeats. The selected gene predictions were improved by PASA. For additional details, see <a href="https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html#!info?alias=Org_SbicolorRio_er>Phytozome</a>.
