### Assembly
The genome assembly of Sorghum PI536008 was reported in Tao et al, 2021. Sequencing was conducted by the Australia Sorghum breeding team in collaboration with BGI-Shenzhen using Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform and the PacBio Sequel platform to achieve 192X and 58X coverage, respectively. The assembly effort generated a genome of 672.5Mb with contigs N50 of 185.1kb.
