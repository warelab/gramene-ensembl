A minimum tiling path of 243 BAC clones<http://www.genome.arizona.edu/orders/direct.html?library=LP_ABa> was selected across the short arm of chromosome 3 of Leersia perrieri using a heavily manually edited physical map< http://www.omap.org/fpc/WebAGCoL/LP_ABa/WebFPC/>. The BACs were divided into eight 3Mb pools and sequenced using Roche GSFLX+ chemistry (shotgun and paired-end reads) to a depth of 25X. Sequence reads were assembled with Newbler v2.6 (Roche 454) followed by order and orientation of the assembled scaffolds and contigs using Genome Puzzle Master (GPM) software (Zhang and Wing. unpublished). The assembly resulted in a single scaffold of 16,229,302 bp with 648 contigs.
