### Annotation

<!-- This browser is based on data from
[Araport11](https://www.araport.org/data/araport11) gene annotation, a
comprehensive reannotation of the TAIR10 genome, released June, 2016.
Details of the structural and functional annotation steps to generate the Araport11
protein-coding gene set as well as consolidation and annotation of
non-coding RNAs are described in <https://doi.org/10.1111/tpj.13415>.

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature
pipeline](http://ensemblgenomes.org/info/data/repeat_features). There
are: 429457 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 17 Mb (7.3% of the
genome); 74964 Repeats (ENA) features, covering 107 Mb (47.2% of the
genome); 70178 RepeatMasker features (with the REdat library), covering
21 Mb (9.2% of the genome); 2198 RepeatMasker features (with the RepBase
library), covering 0 Mb (0.1% of the genome); 147273 Tandem repeats
(TRF) features, covering 13 Mb (5.6% of the genome). -->
