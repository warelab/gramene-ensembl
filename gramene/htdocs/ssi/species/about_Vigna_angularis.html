<h2 id="about">About <em>Vigna angularis</em></h2>

<p><em>Vigna angularis</em> (adzuki bean) is an annual legume crop, widely grown throughout East Asia and the Himalayas for food. It is widely used as an ingredient for traditional dessert cuisines due to its sweet taste, as well as its nutritious protein and starch contents. It is a diploid (2n = 2x = 22) with an estimated genome size of 538 Mbp.</p>

<h3 id="assembly">Assembly</h3>

<p>Paired-end (180 bp) and mate-pair (5 and 10 kbp) libraries were prepared using 100 bp short reads (Illumina HiSeq 2000) and were combined with a single unpaired library of average read length of 458 bp (Roche GS-FLX+) for a total physical coverage of 291x. The assembly produced 3,883 scaffolds with N50 length of 703â€…kbp, covering 75% of the estimated genome size. Scaffolds were assembled into pseudo-molecules using synteny and genetic mapping of a population of 133 F4 lines (814 SNPs in 11 linkage groups).</p>

<p>Gene prediction using the MAKER pipeline revealed 26,857 high confidence protein-coding genes using RNA-Seq of flower, pod, leaf, and root tissues. In total, 86% of the 248 core eukaryotic genes in CEGMA pipeline were matched to the genome assembly.</p>
