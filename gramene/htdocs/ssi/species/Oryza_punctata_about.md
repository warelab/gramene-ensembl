About *Oryza punctata*
---------------------
*Oryza punctata* is a wild rice species native to Africa. Breeders are interested because of demonstrated resistance to bacterial blight and brown plant hoppers. *O. punctata*, a diploid, belongs to the *O. officinalis* complex within the Oryzeae genome groups, and belongs to the BB genome type. It can be found in open or semi-open habitats such as forest margins, grassland and thickets, scrub lands, open bush or shifting cultivation fields, and rice fields. It has 12 chromosomes and a nuclear genome size of 423Mb (flow cytometry). This work was part of the OGE project funded by NSF Award #1026200.
