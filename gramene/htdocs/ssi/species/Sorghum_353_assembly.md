### Assembly
The genome assembly of Sorghum 353 was reported in Tao et al (2021). Sequencing was conducted by the Australia Sorghum breeding team in collaboration with BGI-Shenzhen using Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform and the PacBio Sequel platform to achieve 183X and 35X coverage, respectively. The assembly effort generated a genome of 737.5Mb with contigs N50 of 2.1Mb.
