<h2 id="about">About <em>Oryza sativa</em> Indica</h2>

<p><em>Oryza sativa</em> Indica is one of the two most commonly cultivated sub-species of rice (along with <a href="/Oryza_sativa" title="Oryza sativa in Ensembl Plants"><em>O. sativa</em> Japonica</a>) and is the most widely grown in the hot climates of Southern Asia. The genome of Indica is very similar to that of Japonica, which is generally restricted to temperate climes such as Japan.</p>

<p>The genome of <em>Oryza sativa</em> Indica Group cultivar 93-11 was sequenced by the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS) with PacBio technology and assembled using Canu v.1.5.</p>

<p>Done by Ware Lab researchers at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Initial protein-coding genes were generated with the MAKER-P pipeline (Campbell <i>et al</i>, 2014) using line-specific RNA-seq transcript and full-length transcripts from Zhou <i>et al</i> (2020). Non-overlapping ab initio models were added using SNAP (Korf, 2004), Augustus (Stanke <i>et al</i>, 2008), and FGENESH (Soovyev <i>et al</i>, 2006) gene predictors. The combined gene models were improved for structure including UTR extensions using line-specific full-length transcripts and rice ESTs from GenBank. Final models were quality checked using GFF3toolkit (Chen <i>et al</i>, 2019) and canonical transcripts assigned with TRaCE (Olson and Ware, 2020).</p>
