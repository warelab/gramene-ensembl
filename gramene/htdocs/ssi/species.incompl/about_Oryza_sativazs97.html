<h2>About <i>Oryza sativa</i> XI-1A subgroup OsZS97</h2>


<p>Asian cultivated rice is a staple food for half of the world population. With a genome size of ~390 Mb (n=12), rice has the smallest genome among the domesticated cereals, making it particularly amenable to genomic studies. In 2020, a reanalysis of the population structure analysis showed that rice could be subdivided into a total of 15 subpopulations (XI-1A, XI-1B1, XI-1B2, XI-2B, XI-2A, XI-3B1, XI-3A, XI-3B2, GJ-trop1, GJ-trop2, GJ-subtrp, GJ-tmp, cA2, cA1 and cB) and 4 admixed populations (GJ-adm, XI-adm, admixed and cA-adm). Then 16 rice cultivar varieties were selected based on genetic diversity and origin that could represent the 15 subpopulations and the largest admixed population, <i>i.e.</i> XI-adm. The collection of 16 Platinum Standard RefSeqs (PSRefSeq) can be used as a template to detect virtually all standing natural variation that exists in the pan-genome of cultivated Asian rice. <i>Oryza sativa</i> cv. Zhengshan 97 (collected from: China) is selected as the representative of XI-1A subpopulation, in which the accessions are mostly collected from China. </p>

<p>Notes of Subpopulations: cA = <i>circum</i>-Aus; cB =<i> circum</i>-Basmati; GJ= <i>Geng</i>-japonica where trop = tropical, subtrp = subtropical; XI =<i> Xian</i>-indica</p>


<h2>Assembly</h2>

<p>Scientists from the University of Arizona, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, International Rice Research Institute, and Huazhong Agricultural University generated <i>Oryza sativa</i> cv. Zhengshan 97 genome high quality reference (n=12), which is one of the 16 PSRefSeqs and represents XI-1A subpopulation.</p>
<p>The whole DNA was sequenced by >100 X PacBio cells. The genome assemblies were carried out by multiple assemblers, <i>i.e.</i> mecat2, canu and falcon. The pseudomolecule of each chromosome was constructed using the nucleotide sequence of multiple assemblies by Genome Puzzle Master by using Minghui63 as a guide. The final assembly was polished by  >100 X PacBio corrected reads and > 100 X Illumina clean reads. </p>

<h2>Annotation</h2>

<p>Done by Ware Lab researchers at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Initial protein-coding genes were generated with the MAKER-P pipeline (Campbell <i>et al</i>, 2014) using line-specific RNA-seq transcript and full-length transcripts from Zhou <i>et al</i> (2020). Non-overlapping ab initio models were added using SNAP (Korf, 2004), Augustus (Stanke <i>et al</i>, 2008), and FGENESH (Soovyev <i>et al</i>, 2006) gene predictors. The combined gene models were improved for structure including UTR extensions using line-specific full-length transcripts and rice ESTs from GenBank. Final models were quality checked using GFF3toolkit (Chen <i>et al</i>, 2019) and canonical transcripts assigned with TRaCE (Olson and Ware, 2020).</p>
