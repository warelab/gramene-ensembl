<div class="plain-box"><h2>New Maize B73 Genome Assembly and Gene Annotations</h2>

<p>An entirely new assembly of the maize genome (B73 RefGen_v4) was constructed from PacBio Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing at approximately 60-fold coverage and scaffolded with the aid of a high-resolution whole-genome restriction (optical) mapping. The pseudomolecules of maize B73 RefGen_v4 were assembled nearly end-to-end, representing a 52-fold improvement in average contig size relative to the previous reference (B73 RefGen_v3).</p>

<p>Genes were annotated with the Maker pipeline (Campbell <i>et al</i>, 2014) using 111,000 transcripts obtained by single-molecule sequencing. These long-read Iso-Seq data (Wang <i>et al</i>, 2016) improved annotation of alternative splicing, more than doubling the number of alternative transcripts from 1.5 to 3.8 per gene, thereby improving our knowledge of gene structure and transcript variation, resulting in substantial improvements including resolved gaps and misassembles, corrections to strand, consolidation of gene models, and anchoring of unanchored genes.</p>

<p>Gene annotation was performed in the laboratory of Doreen Ware (CSHL/USDA). Protein-coding genes were identified using MAKER-P software version 3.1 (Campbell <i>et al</i>, 2014) with the following transcript evidence: 111,151 PacBio Iso-Seq long-reads from 6 tissues (Wang <i>et al</i>, 2016), 69,163 full-length cDNAs deposited in Genbank (Alexandrov <i>et al</i>, 2008; Soderlund <i>et al</i>, 2009), 1,574,442 Trinity-assembled transcripts from 94 B73 RNA-Seq experiments (Law <i>et al</i>, 2015), and 112,963 transcripts assembled from deep sequencing of a B73 seedling (Martin <i>et al</i>, 2014). Additional evidence included annotated proteins from <i>Sorghum bicolor</i>, <i>Oryza sativa</i>, <i>Setaria italica</i>, <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> downloaded from Ensembl Plants Release 29 (Oct-2015). Gene calling was assisted by Augustus (Keller <i>et al</i>, 2011) and FGENESH (Salamov & Solovyev, 2000) trained on maize and monocots, respectively. Low-confidence gene calls were filtered on the basis of an Annotation Edit Distance (AED) score and other criteria and are viewable as a separate track. In the end, the higher confidence set (called filtered gene set) has 39,324 protein coding genes. Gene annotations from B73 RefGen_v3 were mapped to the new assembly and are also available as a separate track. In addition, 2,532 long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes were mapped and annotated from prior studies (Li <i>et al</i>, 2014; Wang <i>et al</i>, 2016), while 2,290 tRNA genes were identified using tRNAscan-SE (Lowe & Eddy, 1997), and 154 miRNA genes mapped from miRBase (Kozomara & Griffiths-Jones, 2014).


<h2>New Bread Wheat Genome Assembly</h2>

<p>A new genome assembly of <a href="http://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum"><em>Triticum aestivum</em></a> cv. Chinese Spring is now available in Gramene and Ensembl Plants. The assembly (TGACv1) and it's accompanying annotation was produced by the <a href="http://www.earlham.ac.uk/">Earlham Institute</a>, formerly The Centre for Genome Analysis (TGAC), as part of the<!--nbsp--> <!--nbsp--><a href="http://www.wheatgenome.org.uk/">Triticeae Genomics for Sustainable Agriculture</a><!--nbsp--> <!--nbsp-->project.</p>

<p>The assembly has a scaffold N50 of 88 Kbp and a total length of 13.4 Gbp in contigs greater than 500 bp (<a href="http://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Annotation#assembly">read more</a>). The gene model annotation consists of 217,907<!--nbsp--> <!--nbsp-->loci and 273,739 transcripts. A total of 104,09<!--nbsp--> <!--nbsp-->protein coding genes (154,798 transcripts) and 10,156 long ncRNAs have been annotated with high confidence (<a href="http://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Annotation#annotation">read more</a>). Approximately 99,000 genes (99% of the total) annotated on the previous IWGSC CSS assembly (MIPS) have been mapped to the new assembly.</p>

<p>The Axiom 35k and 820k SNP marker sets have been<!--nbsp--> <!--nbsp-->provided by <a href="http://www.cerealsdb.uk.net/cerealgenomics/CerealsDB/indexNEW.php">CerealsDB</a><!--nbsp--> <!--nbsp-->and located on the new assembly (<a href="http://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Annotation#variation">read more</a>).</p>
