<div class="plain-box"><h2>RNA-Seq Studies for Plants</h2>

<p>New track hubs have been created for more than 900 public RNA-Seq studies, totalling more than 16,000 tracks across 35 plant species (<a href="http://ensemblgenomes.org/info/access/public-track-hubs">read more</a>).</p>

<h2 id="features">Pre-release of the New Bread Wheat Genome</h2>

<p>The new genome assembly of <em>Triticum aestivum</em> cv. Chinese Spring, generated by <a href="http://www.tgac.ac.uk/">The Genome Analysis Centre, Norwich</a> as part of the BBSRCs <a href="http://www.wheatgenome.org.uk/">Triticeae Genomics for Sustainable Agriculture</a> project is now available in the <a href="http://pre.plants.ensembl.org/Triticum_aestivum">Ensembl Plants pre-site</a>. The assembly has a scaffold N50 of 88 Kbp and a total length of 13.4 Gbp in contigs greater than 500 bp. A total of 98,974 genes (99% of the total) annotated on the previous assembly have been located on the new assembly. RNA-Seq data from three different transcriptomics studies across 18 different samples have been aligned and the corresponding transcript assemblies are browsable as additional tracks. Existing variation data (Bristol SNPs) was also projected to the new assembly and can be searched for and viewed in the genome browser.</p>

<p>Data can be searched by gene identifier or by BLAST sequence search. Further annotation will be progressively available over the coming months.</p>

<p>The main <a href="http://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index">Gramene / Ensembl Plants Wheat Site</a> continues to offer a more mature set of annotation on an assembly comprising the IWGSC Chromosome Survey Sequence data (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25035500">IWGSC et al. 2015</a>) supplemented by the chromosome 3B assembly (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25035497">Choulet et al. 2015</a>).</p></div>
