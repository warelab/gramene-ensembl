<div class="plain-box"><h2 id="features">Update assembly for barley</h2>
<p>The <a href="/hordeum_vulgare" title="Barley in Gramene Genomes">barley assembly</a> in Gramene release 43 has been extended and improved with anchoring data from high marker density population sequencing (POPSEQ). With this, an additional 626,000 WGS contigs which were formerly unassigned or assigned to chromosome arms are now anchored to barley chromosomes. Anchoring these contigs assigns chromosomal positions to an additional 760 Mb of sequence, and 1,025 genes.
