<div class="plain-box"><h2>  Prelimiary Sorghum genome assembly and Gene Annotations</h2>

This is a preliminary release of the sorghum genomes sequenced and collected by <a href="https://www.sorghumbase.org/">Sorghumbase</a>.

<p>Gene annotation was performed with MIKDADO software, refined by PASA, evaluated with MAKER-P with flcDNA and iso-Seq.

<!--such as PacBio Iso-Seq long-reads, full-length cDNAs deposited in Genbank, Trinity-assembled transcripts from RNAseq.-->

<p><b>This sequence has been released under theÂ Toronto Agreement. No whole-genome research may be submitted for publication until the official publication for this genome assembly has been published.
