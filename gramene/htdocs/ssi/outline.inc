<h2>Release 69 Highlights</h2>
The Gramene Genome browser is customized based on data from Ensembl Plant release 61 and software from Ensembl 114.
 
<ul>
<li>
Genomes<p>
This release added 83 new genomes from 9 different species, with 75 from Barley. In addition, 7 species were updated with new assemblies.
</li><li>
Comparative genomics
<ul><li><a href="info/genome/compara/prot_tree_stats.html">Protein gene tree</a>:
A total of 164,454 protein-coding gene family trees were constructed using the peptide encoded by
the canonical transcript (i.e., a representative transcript for a given gene) for each
of 4,373,089 individual genes from 119 plant genomes.
</li>
<li><a href="info/genome/compara/compara_analyses.html">Whole Genome Alignments</a>:
There are 598 pairwise genomic alignments among 144 species. The majority of species in Gramene were aligned with <i>Oryza sativa</i> Japonica
(reference monocot), and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and <i>Vitis vinifera</i> (reference dicots).
</li><li>
<a href="info/genome/compara/compara_analyses.html">Synteny</a>:
204 paired synteny maps are available.
</li>
<li>
Putative Split Genes:
Updated split genes for the current release are available on <a href="http://ftp.gramene.org/CURRENT_RELEASE/splitgenes/">the FTP site</a>. These are putative gene annotation artifacts (also known as contiguous gene split models) and are based on the latest Ensembl Compara Gene Tree database. Overall statistics for each species is given in the <a href="https://ftp.gramene.org/CURRENT_RELEASE/split_genes/1_ReadMe_SplitGenesBySpecies.txt">README</a>.

</ul>
</li>

<li>
Variation
<p>
Data available for 19 plant species, including Arabidopsis, maize, rice (Japonica, Indica, <i>O.glaberrima</i> and <i>O.glumaepatula</i>), brachypodium, sunflower, barley, apple, tomato, sorghum, grapevine, bread and durum wheat, cucumber, black bean, lettuce, and cocoa.
<p>
Additional Watkins Wheat variation data has been added for <i>Triticum aestivum</i> (Common wheat; GCA_900519105.1). The Watkins Wheat variation collection encompasses the genetic diversity found in the A.E. Watkins Landrace Collection of bread wheat, which includes 827 landraces from 32 countries.
<p>
</li>

<li>
Expression<p>
Atlas views of expression data from a total of  449 plant RNA-seq experiments.
</li>
<li>
The Plant Reactome was updated in April, 2025 and includes 10 new and 5 updated pathways involved in flowering under drought stress, root and shoot gravitropism, and salinity response for a total of 351 manually curated rice pathways projected via orthology to 138 genomes.
</li>
<li>
A left side navBar node was added to link the gene from genome browser to Gramene search interface. <a href="Oryza_sativa/Gene/GrameneSearch?g=Os05g0421750;r=5:20683551-20684336;t=Os05t0421750-00">For example: Os05g0421750</a>
</li>
<li>
Gramene Mart will no longer be hosting a mirror of <a href="https://plants.ensembl.org/biomart/martview">Ensembl Plants BioMart</a>, instead it will redirect the user to the Ensembl Plants BioMart.
</li>
</ul>
