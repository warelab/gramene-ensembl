<h1>Genomic variation</h1>

<p>Sorghumbase provides genomic variation data, including 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 
various sources, for which any effects on transcripts in the area are calculated</p>

<p>For now, variant data is imported from VCF files obtained from collaborators or 3rd party providers.
The exact source of variant data is provided on the information page for each 
genome in the Ensembl browser (e.g. <a href="/Sorghum_bicolor/Info/Annotation#variation"><i>BTx623</i></a>).
