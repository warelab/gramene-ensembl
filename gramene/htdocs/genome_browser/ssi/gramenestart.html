<h3 class="boxed">About Gramene</h3>

<p>Gramene is a comparative genome database for cereal crops and a
community resource agricultural researchers and plant breeders of rice
and other grasses. Our goal is to facilitate the study of
cross-species homology relationships using information derived from
public projects involved in genomic and EST sequencing, protein
structure and function analysis, genetic and physical mapping,
interpretation of biochemical pathways, gene and QTL localization,
controlled vocabularies and descriptions of phenotypic characters and
mutations. <a href="/about/index.html">[more]</a></p>

<p>The current Gramene version is 29, released in March 2009. This release is based on Ensembl 52, released in December 2008. For details on what's new in this release, see <a href="/db/help?state=current_release_notes#genomes">NEWS</a></p>
