<h3>Estimation of Syntenic Spans between Maize and Rice</h3>

EST clusters and EST singletons attached to the maize FPC map were
identified via correspondence with <a
href="http://www.genome.arizona.edu/fpc/maize/#info">overgos</a>
placed on the map as physical markers. Of these sequences, only those
that hit an FPContig through multiple clones (BACs) were considered
for further analysis.<br>&nbsp;<br>

The sequences associated with the resulting list of overgos were
aligned to the rice pseudomolecule assembly using BLAT (with
parameters -minIdentity=50 followed by PslReps with -singleHit). The
alignments were further filtered using the following criteria;<br>
<ul><li> Alignment length was greater than 150 basepairs and, </li>
    <li> Sequences with more than 3 hits to the genome of equal 
         value were discarded.</li></ul>

The alignments were used to construct a sorted pairwise list of
locations on the maize FPC map and their corresponding locations on
the rice genome. For each location on a given maize FPContig, if the
distance between adjacent points on rice fell within a distance of
300kb, a syntenic span was constructed.<p/>
